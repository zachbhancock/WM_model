# Wright-Malecot Model in R for Spatial Population Genetic Inference
This repository is where the WM model lives. This model is coded in R and is used to estimate Wright's neighborhood size, collecting-phase pi, in-Deme coalescent rates, etc. User inputs are a pairwise pi matrix and a pairwise geographic distance matrix. User can specify kappa, which is the distance at which panmixia is assumed (i.e., individuals very close to one another). 

The WM model was coded by GS Bradburd and tested by ZB Hancock and RH Toczydlowski. See Hancock et al. (in prep).
